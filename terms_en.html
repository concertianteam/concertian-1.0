            <p>
            2.1 Within the scope of system concertian, organiser is considered to be an organization or facility organizing cultural event of live music, theatrical, educational character, concert or musical performance, also - workshop, exhibition, sport event or any other event (using the system concertian for this purpose), which is in contractual relationship with quawer s.r.o., created after successful registration on basis of terms and conditions defined for organizers.

            <a>3.Concert/Event/Musical performance
            </a>
            <p>
            3.1 Event or concert is understood as any cultural event created inside of the system concertian by organiser, who has to include all unnecessary data including date and  time of event, performers, extra details if needed and other. Quawer s.r.o. is not author and is not responsible for concerts founded by organizers.

The ticket price can be also changed by time the concerts will take place, but ticket owner cannot be asked to pay difference between the price of ticked he bought and the price of the at the time of concert (on enter), once he bought it.

As the owner based on owner ticket and after proving your identity as an owner of entrance ticket, you are allowed for one-time enter. After that, the purpose of the ticket is fulfilled, and it is not possible to apply it again. For instance after leaving the place where performance takes place before the end of concert, you are not allowed to enter it again based on ticket, which was already used.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            6.2 It is required to show your ticket at the entrance to the event, therefore we accepted two ways of doing so:
            </p>
            <p>
            a)	Printed ticket – you are free to print your ticket with laser or inkjet printer, but the size of your ticket (paper) should coincide with the size of entry ticket and the size should not be obstacle to certainly identify the valid ticket. It is not necessary to print your ticket,<br>
            b)	Open PDF format shown in your smartphone. It is necessary to have installed software to open pdf documents and it´s absence is not acceptable argument, when you are not able to open the pdf ticket to prove your presence at the entrance. Therefore we suggest to prepare your pdf ticket properly, before going to an event.

            <p>
            6.3 Any attempts to false or duplicate tickets for an event are punishable and are going to be solved on cost of guilty party. These attempts have also negative impact on the whole ticket entry system and will result in requirements for better documentation to prove the validity.
