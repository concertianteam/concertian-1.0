            </a>
            <p>quawer Ltd., based in Braneckého 1523/4, 949 01 Nitra, ID: 48243043 (Company Registration Number), entered in the Commercial Register of the District Court Nitra, Section Ltd., insert no. 97115/B (hereinafter "Service Provider") is an author and operator of Internet-based Web Service Application domain concertian.com (hereinafter "concertian").
            </p>
            <p>
            Concertian is an effective tool for organizing cultural events through innovative setting, resembling a combination of calendar and editable tables, created for fulfilling the needs while organizing cultural events. The main benefit comes from an integral part called „choose the best term“, which serves the most economic term for organising concert. The function of direct export of created events encompassing subject of the event, date and time, in order to promote the programme to the third parties together with function of direct tickets selling is an integral part of the Application, too.
            </p>
            <p>
            Based on agreement between organizers (hereinafter "the organizer") and concertian, quawer s.r.o. is fully allowed to provide ticket sales to final customers (visitors) through the automated system of concertian situated on domain concertian.com, where you can find mentioned concert tickets together with unnecessary information.
            </p>
            <a>Organiser
            </a>
            <p>
            Within the scope of system concertian, organiser is considered to be an organization or facility organizing cultural event of live music character, concert or musical performance (using the system concertian for this purpose), which is in contractual relationship with quawer s.r.o., created after successful registration on basis of terms and conditions defined for organizers. Thanks to this document is quawer s.r.o. allowed to figure as a seller (broker) of tickets, with all rights and needs, for concerts founded by organiser.
            </p>
            <a>Concert/Event/Musical performance
            </a>
            <p>
            Event or concert is understood as any cultural event created inside of the system concertian by organiser, who has to include all unnecessary data including date and  time of event, performers, extra details if needed and other. Quawer s.r.o. is not author and is not responsible for concerts founded by organizers. To be able to sell tickets you do not just need to use our system for managing concerts, but also you have to undergo process divided to two steps.  
            </p>
            <p>
            For first you have to create valid concert with true data, you as an organiser are responsible for and submit it for public audience by adding status “complete”. Every aspect of doing this is covered by contract between organiser and quawer s.r.o. and it is not contradictable.
            </p>
            <p>
            Second step is aimed for the case, when organiser wants to sell valid tickets. After filing the offer formula and setting the quantity and unit price, organiser is asked to confirm the extra contract add about terms and conditions of selling tickets through concertian.
            </p>
            <p>
            Price of entry tickets is set by organiser and it is not influented by concertian, therefore quawer s.r.o. is not responsible for the price of ticket, whether is too high or not. The ticket price can be also changed by time the concerts will take place, but ticket owner cannot be asked to pay difference between the price of ticked he bought and the price of the at the time of concert (on enter), once he bought it.
            </p>
            <p>
            The event is a public performance of musical character, or a concert (musical or audio-visual even) held in Slovakie, Czech Republic and Hungary, on which concertian serves tickets under the conditions of this document
            </p>
            <p>
            The current list of events ca n be found on website <a class="link" href="https:/concertian.com">www.concertian.com</a>.
            </p>
            <a>Visitor/User/Ticket owner
            </a>
            <p>
            Any person who search for a concert on concertian.com is considered to be a user/ visitor of concertian.com. As the person enters the process of filling out the order form, submits it and does a payment, figures as valid owner of the bought ticket. Holder/owner of ticket is also the person for whom the visitor buys a ticket and which is able to give a proof of identity of the owner at entrance.
            </p>
            <a>Entrance ticket/Ticket
            </a>
            <p>
            A valid ticket is a valuable document and certificate, which allows the ticket owner to enter the event, which ticket was bought for. As the owner based on owner ticket and after proving your identity as an owner of entrance ticket, you are allowed for one-time enter. After that, the purpose of the ticket is fulfilled, and it is not possible to apply it again. For instance after leaving the place where performance takes place before the end of concert, you are not allowed to enter it again based on ticket, which was already used.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tickets may not be offered for resale, return to sale, exchange or duplicated. Any attempt to reproduce the ticket, by making duplicates of it, is forbidden and punishable.
            </p>
            <p>
            The ticket is only valid in case, when identity and purchase data coincide, making it applicable just once and for event, which was purchased for.
            </p>
            <p>
            Entrance ticket serves as a valid certificate for one time entry (limited to date and time of the event it was bought for – also written on its cover).
            </p>
            <p>
            Actual prices and available tickets are listed on concertian.com, where they can be also purchased under the terms and conditions of this document.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ticket also stands as a receipt or proof of payment for selected event and it gives a right to owner to enter and remain in the area, where event takes place. Ticket contains the following information, therefore we do not recommend any further spreading:
            </p>
            <p>
            a)	name of the event or name of performers,<br>
            b)	entry price (price of the ticket) at the time of buying it,<br>
            c)	place, date and time of concert,<br>
            d)	an unique identifier consist of 6 numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every visitor has a right to buy just limited number of tickets, unless it is closer specified by event. Quawer s.r.o. reserves the right to limit the amount of tickets sold to visitors based on its decision.
            </p>
            <p>
            To do so, there is an automated system situated on concertian.com, where we refresh the list of concerts automatically right after there is a new one. Event tickets can be bought without any further registration and is done just by inserting basic information – name, surname and email (to which we send ticket after successful checkout).
            </p>
            <p>
            The only way to purchase tickets is to use payment gateway Braintree provided by Paypal. It is a credit card payment system, where you insert the number of your credit card, month/year of expiration and security code you can find on back of your card. The range of supported cards is wide, for instance – Maestro, Mastercard, Visa and others. There is also the option to pay for ticket via paypal. Any other form of payment is not supported and technically feasible.
            </p>
            <p>
            All information including the credit card identifiers are securely processed by Paypal Inc., therefore the whole process is secure and without risk. Further details about protecting personal and purchase information is more described in section privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
            Personal details you have submitted (name, surname, email contact and other), are beside identification of the ticket owner also used for customer service improvement. It is important to mention, that identification data like name, surname are going to be present on ticket label, therefore we recommend to keep ticket for yourself. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After successful complete of order form and submitting it, you are going to be asked to proceed to payment (checkout). As our system receives positive answer from Braintree, that payment was accepted for further process, the confirmation email including the pdf form of ticket is send to email address you provided in order form. You should be able to see confirmation email in your mailbox within 24 hours (usually 5-15 minutes).
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <a>Delivery</a>
            <p>
            As it is written above, the delivery of entry ticket to ticket owner is done automatically by our system into your mailbox, with address you provided in order form. Ticket owner is supposed to check the information provided on ticket to ensure, that ticket was generated without mistakes and personal data, date, time and name of event agrees with concert, the ticket was bought for.

            </p>
            <p>
            It is required to show your ticket at the entrance to the event, therefore we accepted two ways of doing so:
            </p>
            <p>
            1.	Printed ticket – you are free to print your ticket with laser or inkjet printer, but the size of your ticket (paper) should coincide with the size of entry ticket and the size should not be obstacle to certainly identify the valid ticket. It is not necessary to print your ticket,<br>
            2.	Open PDF format shown in your smartphone. It is necessary to have installed software to open pdf documents and it´s absence is not acceptable argument, when you are not able to open the pdf ticket to prove your presence at the entrance. Therefore we suggest to prepare your pdf ticket properly, before going to an event. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Any attempts to false or duplicate tickets for an event are punishable and are going to be solved on cost of guilty party. These attempts have also negative impact on the whole ticket entry system and will result in requirements for better documentation to prove the validity. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Each ticket has a unique identification number that identifies the owner and the payment for the ticket, therefore any attempts to illegally bypass system can be easily track down.
            </p>
